# Missionaries and Cannibals Game

This is a Python-based graphical implementation of the classic "Missionaries and Cannibals" puzzle game using the Pygame library. The game involves three missionaries and three cannibals who need to cross a river using a boat, without ever leaving a group of missionaries in a situation where they are outnumbered by cannibals.

## Problem Statement
The goal of the game is to move all missionaries and cannibals from one side of the river to the other using a boat, while ensuring that at no point do the cannibals outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river.

- **Objective**: Transfer all missionaries and cannibals to the other side of the river.
- **Constraints**:
  - The boat can carry at most two people at a time.
  - At no point on either side of the river can cannibals outnumber missionaries.
  
## Game Rules:
1. The game starts with three missionaries and three cannibals on one side of the river, along with a boat.
2. The player must move missionaries and cannibals across the river while ensuring that:
   - If there are more cannibals than missionaries on either side of the river, the cannibals will eat the missionaries.
   - The boat can carry only two characters at a time, and the characters on the boat must be either two missionaries, two cannibals, or one of each.
3. The game ends when all characters have successfully crossed to the other side of the river.

## Features:
- **Missionaries and Cannibals**: Six characters with distinct visual representations.
- **Boat**: A boat used to transport the characters across the river.
- **Interactive Game Board**: Click to select characters and move them across the river.
- **Game States**:
  - Display of the current state, showing the number of missionaries and cannibals on both shores.
  - Action buttons for moving characters across the river.
  - Sound controls and game-over conditions.
  
## Installation:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/missionaries-and-cannibals-game.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   Make sure you have Python 3.x installed, and then install the Pygame library:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. Download or ensure you have the required image and sound files in the proper directory.
   These files should be placed in the directory paths specified in the code or updated accordingly.

4. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Gameplay:
- Use the mouse to click on the missionaries and cannibals to select them and move them across the river.
- The boat can carry two people at a time, so select two characters and click on the boat to move them across.
- Watch out for the game-over condition where cannibals outnumber missionaries on either side of the river.

## Algorithm:
- The game uses simple logic to update the state of the missionaries and cannibals on both shores of the river based on player actions.
- The game maintains the state of the boat, and ensures that no invalid moves are made that would result in the death of any missionaries.
- It checks for game-over conditions and triggers the appropriate actions.
